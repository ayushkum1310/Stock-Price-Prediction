 Project Summary: Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Objective:
The goal of this project is to predict Apple stock prices using a linear regression model based on historical commodity prices, volumes, and stock prices. Interns will explore and apply machine learning techniques, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and prediction system creation.
Dataset:
A historical dataset containing various commodity prices, volumes, and stock prices, including Apple’s price, will be used for analysis and prediction.
Week 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
1. Data Import and Understanding:
   - Load the dataset and inspect the first few rows.
   - Check for data types, missing values, and summary statistics to understand data distribution.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualize the distribution of the target variable, `Apple_Price`.
   - Use scatter plots to analyze relationships between `Apple _Price` and other features.
   - Compute and visualize the correlation matrix to identify significant features.

3. Feature Engineering:
   - Handle missing values by imputing them with the mean.
   - Standardize features using `StandardScaler`.
Week 2: Model Development
1. Data Splitting:
   - Define features (`X`) and the target variable (`y`).
   - Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
2. Model Training:
   - Initialize and train a linear regression model on the training data.
   - Make predictions on the testing data.
   - Evaluate model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Week 3: Model Validation and Testing
1. Cross-Validation:
   - Perform 5-fold cross-validation to assess the model’s robustness and generalization.
   - Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the cross-validation scores.
2. Testing on Unseen Data:
   - Use a portion of recent data for validation.
   - Predict on recent data and evaluate using MAE and RMSE.
3. Feature Importance Analysis:
   - Analyze the coefficients of the linear regression model to determine feature importance.
   - Visualize feature importance using a bar plot to interpret which features significantly affect the stock price.
 Conclusion:
By following this workflow, the interns will develop a strong understanding of building and evaluating a stock price prediction model using linear regression. This project will reinforce key machine learning concepts and equip them with practical skills for real-wo
